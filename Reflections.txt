How long did you spend working on this project?
  15 - 20 hours spread out over about 10 days plus about 3 hours today on lunch and after work (This is a resubmit).
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  OLD - The rewarding challenge I beat was probably finding a way to make the .product or .title etc methods work. I spent alot of time researching, and think I came up with the proper way to implement them.
  NEW - This resubmission. If it wasnt for the help of the initial reviewer I would have finished this project. Previously    i didnt understand attr_accessor etc I just used them because the istructions said to. Now i have a better understanding of alot more.
What two additional features did you build? Why?
  The first feature was just a small report generator of all the transactions. The second was just adding Time.new as a value for product hash in the transactions class. This is because I think it is very important to track the time products are being purchased, so you can easier issue refunds and keep better bookkeeping.
Where do you still have room to grow?
  Alot of places. I think Im still only beginning to understand the basic ruby methods and how they can be applied. I need to continue to read the docs make sure im finding the best possible methods in my code.
